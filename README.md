# Advice Portal Smart Contract

The project was built from _buildspace Wave Portal Project. 

This project demonstrates a basic Smart Contract in solidity for an advice portal. 

The contract allows users to send messages view the blockchain. 

The following are stored on the blockchain:
- sender
- message 
- timestamp 

The events functions allows the dapp to be notified once there is a new message added to the portal.
